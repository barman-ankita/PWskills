        "examples of common types of constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** SQL constraints are rules enforced on the data columns of a table to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. Their primary purpose is to maintain data integrity by preventing invalid or inconsistent data from being entered into the database. Think of them as gatekeepers for your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "By setting these rules, you control the type and format of data that can be stored, which is crucial for building a robust and trustworthy database. When an action (like an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) violates a constraint, the database system rejects the operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Common Types of Constraints**\n",
        "Here are some of the most common constraints used in SQL, along with examples:\n",
        "  - NOT NULL: This constraint ensures that a column cannot have a NULL (empty) value. It's essential for fields that must always contain information.\n",
        "    - Example: In a users table, the username and password columns should not be empty.\n",
        "  - UNIQUE: This ensures that every value in a column is different from all other values in that same column.\n",
        "    - Example: An email address or a social_security_number in a customer table must be unique for each customer.\n",
        "  - PRIMARY KEY: This constraint is a combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. It uniquely identifies each record in a table. A table can have only one primary key.\n",
        "    - Example: An employee_id in an employees table serves as the primary key to distinguish each employee.\n",
        "  - FOREIGN KEY: This key links two tables together by referencing the PRIMARY KEY of another table. It enforces referential integrity, meaning you can't add a record to one table that refers to a non-existent record in another.\n",
        "    - Example: An orders table might have a customer_id that is a FOREIGN KEY pointing to the id in the customers table. This prevents an order from being created for a customer who doesn't exist.\n",
        "  - CHECK: This constraint ensures that the values in a column satisfy a specific condition or logical expression.\n",
        "    - Example: In a products table, you could have a CHECK (price >= 0) constraint to ensure the price is never a negative number.\n",
        "  - DEFAULT: This provides a default value for a column when no value is specified during an INSERT operation.\n",
        "    - Example: A registration_date column in a users table could have a DEFAULT value of the current date.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans:** You would apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column to guarantee that every record in the table has a value for that specific attribute. It's a fundamental rule of data integrity that ensures essential information is always present.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The primary reasons for using it are:**\n",
        "  1. To Ensure Completeness: For certain fields, missing data makes a record meaningless or useless. For example, an orders table without a product_id or a users table without a username is incomplete and serves no purpose.\n",
        "  2. To Avoid Errors in Calculations and Functions: NULL is not the same as zero or an empty string; it represents an unknown or missing value. Mathematical operations (like SUM, AVG) or other functions can behave unexpectedly or produce errors when they encounter NULL values. Forcing a column to be NOT NULL ensures predictable behavior.\n",
        "  3. To Improve Data Quality and Reliability: By requiring certain data to be present, you enforce a higher standard of data quality from the moment it is entered. This makes the entire database more reliable and trustworthy for queries and reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ( Example: In an employees table, the emp_name and start_date columns should be NOT NULL. An employee record without a name or a start date is incomplete and could cause issues in HR and payroll systems. )\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "(**Can a Primary Key Contain NULL Values?**)\n",
        "\n",
        "No, a primary key cannot contain NULL values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Justification:** The entire purpose of a primary key is to serve as a unique identifier for every single row in a table. It's the definitive address for a record, ensuring that you can find and reference it without any ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "This core purpose relies on two fundamental principles, which are automatically enforced by the PRIMARY KEY constraint:\n",
        "  1. Uniqueness: Every value in the primary key column must be unique. You can't have two employees with the same employee_id.\n",
        "  2. Existence: Every record must have a primary key value.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a primary key were allowed to be NULL, it would directly violate this second principle. A NULL value signifies an \"unknown\" or \"missing\" identifier. If one or more rows had a NULL primary key, they would no longer be uniquely identifiable. How would you distinguish between two different records if both had a NULL ID? You couldn't.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, by definition, a PRIMARY KEY constraint is functionally a combination of the UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints. This is a non-negotiable rule in relational database design because it's the bedrock upon which data integrity and relationships between tables are built.\n",

        "**The Consequences of a Violation**\n",
        "\n",
        "The consequences are immediate and designed to protect the database at all costs:\n",
        "  1. The Operation is Rejected: The DBMS immediately stops the execution of the SQL command. The requested change is not made to the table.\n",
        "  2. An Error Message is Returned: The database sends a descriptive error message back to the application or user who issued the command. This message explains which constraint was violated and often provides details about the conflicting data.\n",
        "  3. The Transaction is Rolled Back: Database operations are typically performed within a transaction. If any part of a transaction violates a constraint, the entire transaction is aborted and rolled back. This ensures the database remains in a consistent state, as if the operation never happened. No partial or invalid data is left behind.\n",

If you try to delete a record from a \"parent\" table (e.g., deleting a customer from the customers table) while there are still records in a \"child\" table that reference it (e.g., orders in the orders table for that customer), the deletion will be blocked to prevent creating \"orphaned\" records.\n",

        "While both are crucial for a well-structured relational database, primary keys and foreign keys serve fundamentally different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Primary Key (PK):** The primary key's main job is to be the unique identifier for each record in a table. It's like a Social Security Number for each rowâ€”it ensures you can pinpoint one specific record with no ambiguity.\n",
        "  - Purpose: To uniquely identify a row.\n",
        "  - Uniqueness: Must always be unique. No two rows in the same table can have the same primary key value.\n",
        "  - Null Values: Cannot contain NULL values. Every record must have a primary key.\n",
        "  - Quantity: A table can have only one primary key (though that key can be composed of multiple columns).\n",
        "\n",
        "(*Example from mavenmovies: In the actor table, actor_id is the primary key. There is only one actor with the ID '1', one actor with the ID '2', and so on. This key allows us to uniquely identify every actor in the database.*)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Foreign Key (FK):** The foreign key's main job is to create a link or relationship between two tables. It's a column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. This is how you connect related data.\n",
        "  - Purpose: To link two tables and enforce referential integrity.\n",
        "  - Uniqueness: Can contain duplicate values. Multiple rows can refer to the same foreign key value.\n",
        "  - Null Values: Can contain NULL values (unless a NOT NULL constraint is also applied). A NULL foreign key means the record is not linked to anything in the other table.\n",
        "  - Quantity: A table can have multiple foreign keys, linking it to several other tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example from mavenmovies:** In the film table, language_id is a foreign key. It points to the language_id (the primary key) in the language table. Many films can have the same language_id (e.g., many films can be in English), so this column will have duplicate values. This key ensures that you can't assign a language_id to a film that doesn't exist in the language table.\n"

        "      - fad1.film_id = fad2.film_id: This ensures that we only pair actors who appeared in the exact same film.\n",
        "      - fad1.actor_id < fad2.actor_id: This clever condition accomplishes two things:\n",
        "          - It prevents an actor from being paired with themselves (since actor_id can't be less than itself).\n",
        "          - It eliminates duplicate pairs. Without it, you would get a row for (Actor A, Actor B) and another for (Actor B, Actor A). This condition ensures you only get the pair once.\n",
        "  4. JOIN film f ON fad1.film_id = f.film_id: After finding the pairs, we join with the film table to get the title of the movie they appeared in together, making the report much more readable.\n",
